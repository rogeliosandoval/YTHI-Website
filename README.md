<b><i>*This is an updated version of the previous website I created with Svelte</i></b>
<br>
<br>
This is a website built for a home inspection comapny that gives their clients a place to reference. Clients can book inspections, learn more about the company, apply for job positions or simply look up contact information. Links to the socials are also provided on the footer where they can always be accessed.
<br>
<br>
Overall the main goal of this project is to make a fully functional website that allows clients to not only book inspections online, but to take care of comments, questions or concerns that they may have while considering getting a home inspection.
